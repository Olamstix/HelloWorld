# ToDo App

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple ToDo application developed to explore the JavaScript language's basic syntax and functionality. As a software engineer, I created this project to enhance my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML to produce dynamic and interactive web pages.

The software serves as an introductory example of how JavaScript can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and handle user interactions. While the current implementation simply displays an alert, the project lays the groundwork for more complex features in a ToDo app, such as adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed.
